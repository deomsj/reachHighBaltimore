      <h1>Learn to Row!</h1>
      <h3 class="left">Interested in joining?</h3>
      <p class="statement-left">Reach High is committed to developing scholar/athletes who are confident, dedicated, disciplined, hardworking, and respectful of others, whether in a boat, in the classroom, at home, or in public. We expect Reach High scholar/athletes to work hard in middle school, go to high achieving high schools on college prep tracks, develop a strong academic and athletic resume, and be sought out and accepted by top colleges. For that to happen, we expect Reach High rowers to be with the program for at least one season (fall, spring, summer) a year until they go to college.</p>
      <p class="statement-left">Programs begin with swimming. All rowers must demonstrate swimming competence. We use the Cherry Hill Aquatic Center; when each rower is sufficiently competent in the water, he or she will return to the boathouse for rowing.</p>
      <p class="statement-left">In the middle school years, Reach High emphasizes teamwork, rowing skills, nutrition and fitness as well as academics. When sufficiently prepared and ready, some middle school youth enter competitive racing boats.</p>
      <p class="statement-left">Although brand new rowers are allowed to enroll each new season, the Reach High summer camp (Camp Waters) is the ideal time to learn to row and improve swimming skills. While the middle school years emphasize fundamental rowing skills, fitness, nutrition, teamwork and fun, some exceptional middle school rowers who have been in the program several seasons enter competitive racing boats.</p>
      <p class="statement-left">In high school years, Reach High rowers join BRC’s Juniors program and compete in regattas along the eastern seaboard and develop a resume for potential college recruitment. SAT prep, college visits, and help with the college application process are all part of being a Reach High scholar/rower.</p>
      <p class="statement-left">Transportation is not provided to and from the boathouse; parents carpool to many of our regattas.  Many parents use carpooling to help in this situation.</p>
      <p class="statement-left">Reach High Baltimore: Rowers Empowering Baltimore Youth is an outreach program of the Baltimore Rowing Club that fosters academic and athletic excellence in Baltimore City youth. Through BRC’s contributions of high quality racing shells, safety equipment, launches, and overhead expenses, supplemented by substantial gifts from Baltimore foundations, corporations, and individuals within and outside BRC, we are able to provide equipment and offer scholarships that defray 75-100% of the actual cost per child each season of rowing in spring, summer, and fall. In addition, through two fundraising events, The Baltimore Invitational and the Middle Branch Waterfront Festival and Regatta, all families have the opportunity to contribute time and energy into raising the funds to make Reach High Baltimore possible. At the bottom of this page, you will find our corporate and foundation sponsors. Please visit our Facebook page to see us in action through the seasons.</p>
